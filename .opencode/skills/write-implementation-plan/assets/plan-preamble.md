# How to use this plan

> **You are the implementing agent.** This document is your runbook for one cohesive change to this codebase. It was written collaboratively by Claude and a human after a planning discussion, and it is the source of truth for this work. Read this preamble in full before doing anything else.

## What you're holding

A phase-by-phase implementation plan. Each phase is a **vertical slice** — an end-to-end working increment that leaves the codebase in a working state. Phases are designed so any one of them can be implemented by a fresh agent in a new context window, with only this document and the codebase as input.

## Your job

1. **Read the document header in full first.** TL;DR, Context, Decisions log, Architecture overview, and Files-touched index. These give you the *why* behind every step. The Decisions log especially — those decisions were made deliberately and explain choices that may otherwise look arbitrary or wrong. Reference IDs (D-NN) appear inside phase steps so you can look up rationale.

2. **Find your starting phase.** Scan the phase list. Pick the first phase whose status is `☐ Not started` AND whose `Depends on:` phases are all `✅ Complete`. Implement that phase only. **Do not skip ahead. Do not implement multiple phases in one go unless the human explicitly asks.**

3. **Run the prereq verification.** Each phase has a "Verification (run BEFORE starting)" block. Run those commands. **If any fail, STOP** — the codebase isn't in the state this phase expects. Surface to the human: "Phase N's prereqs failed: `<command>` returned `<result>`. Want me to investigate or hand back?"

4. **Follow the steps in order.** Code blocks in steps are the actual code, not pseudocode or sketches. Apply them as written.

5. **If reality doesn't match the step — STOP.** If the plan says "modify line 47 of `auth.py`" and line 47 is something different, do not improvise. Surface the discrepancy: "Plan expected `<X>` at `auth.py:47`, found `<Y>`. Possible causes: plan is stale, file was edited since planning, plan was wrong. How should I proceed?"

6. **Run the tests and post-verification.** Each phase specifies what tests to add or update and the bash command to run. All must pass before the phase is considered done.

7. **Update status and commit.** When the phase is complete:
   - Edit this document: change the phase's `Status:` line to `✅ Complete — <commit-sha-here>`.
   - `git add` the code changes AND this plan file.
   - Commit them together. Suggested message: `Phase N: <phase title>` (with longer body referencing the plan file).
   - The status update and the code change live in the same commit so the doc and the code never drift.

## What you must NOT do

- **Do not skip phases.** Order matters; later phases assume earlier ones completed.
- **Do not modify the Decisions log, the Operating manual preamble, the TL;DR, the Architecture overview, the Files-touched index, the Open questions, the Out-of-scope list, or the References.** Those are immutable above-the-phases content. If you discover a decision is wrong, surface to the human — don't silently revise.
- **Do not re-plan or re-architect.** If the plan seems wrong, that's a signal to stop and surface, not to improvise.
- **Do not implement multiple phases without surfacing for human review** between them, unless the user explicitly asked for batch execution upfront.

## If you get stuck

- Update the phase's `Status:` to `🛑 Blocked: <one-line reason>`.
- Fill in the phase's `Notes (filled in during implementation)` block with what you tried, what's blocking, and what you'd want to know to unblock.
- Hand back to the human.

## Status vocabulary

- `☐ Not started`
- `🟡 In progress`
- `🛑 Blocked: <reason>`
- `✅ Complete — <commit-sha>`

## When status markers and reality drift

The status markers are a fast read, but they are not the source of truth. The phase's `Verification (DONE)` commands are the truth — if you suspect a marker is wrong (someone forgot to update, branches diverged, partial commits, etc.), run the verification commands for the phases marked complete. Trust the commands over the markers, and surface the drift to the human so the markers can be corrected.
